  If you face while running the application then drop all the tables which is created by  previous application as same tables are used with different 
constraint so it may create the problem to srop and application may crash during startUp.

SELECT
  TABLE_NAME,
  COLUMN_NAME,
  CONSTRAINT_NAME,   -- <<-- the one you want! 
  REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME,
  REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE
  REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = 'person_details';
  
  
  @ManyToMany mapping the hibernate will create new table as 1 vehicle used by many persons and 1 persons uses many vehicle.
  In this condition we need to ManyToMany mapping.
  
  @ManyToMany() --> In this Hibernate will need to create the new table always.
  
  In ManyToMany mapping we need to have Collection of Vehicle in person class and collection of person in Vehicle class.
  
  In ManyToMany mapping if we don't give mappedby in any of the Entity class then Hibernate will create the 2 new table 
  1 for person_details_vehicle and other as vehicle_person_details which is not 
  good to we use mappedby to tell the Hibernate it needs to create only one table.
  
  In the annotation in which we have used mappedby tells the Hibernate not to do mapping and does not do mapping 
  and also tells the name of the object who is doing the mapping
