@OneToMany(mappedBy = "person") --> This will tell Hibernate not to create new table  but mapped 
this which the object which is given as person.
This "person" will the name of the object where we used ManyToOne mapping.

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name ="person_id") --> THis used to create the new column in person_Vehicle table i.e. 
Vehicle entity class and this be mapped by the person_details table.

@NotFound(action=NotFoundAction.IGNORE) --> It used to suppress the Exception if the value of the 
object is null and we are using getter of the object to get the value in our code.
@NotFound(action=NotFoundAction.IGNORE) --> This is the Hibernate specific annotation and does not belong to JPA.
