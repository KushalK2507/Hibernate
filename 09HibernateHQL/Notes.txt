In HQL instead of passing the table name we pass class name OR the name of the object mentioned in @Entity annotation.
In HQL using the where clause we give the name of dataType instead of giving the name of column name.

So Basically in HQL instead dealing with tabe_name and column_name we use class name the properties i.e. it member variable name.
