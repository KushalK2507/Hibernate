Now in this we change the strategy as Table per class strategy i.e every entity class has its own table.
In Vehicle class we give the Inhertiance strategy as Table per class.
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS) --> This strategy is given in the 
parent class of base class as which shows every child class has its own table

When using @Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS) we need to make 
sure the primary key Generation we are using is GenerationType.TABLE else it will mappingExpection in application start Up.

In this all the child tables i.e. 2wheeler and 4Wheeler table will have all the fields that are present in parent class.
