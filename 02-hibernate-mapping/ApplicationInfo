In this we have 2 Entity class
1. Person
2. House
For Now we are considering 1 Person can have only 1 house, so it gives one To one mapping.

Points To Remember
Now if we save the Person object and commit in DB and does not save the House object using session.save then it will give 
the Exception as :
"IllegalStateException: org.hibernate.TransientObjectException: object references an unsaved transient instance - 
save the transient instance before flushing: org.kushal.hibernate.entity.House".

If we don't use the mappedby Annotation then by default running this application will create the 5 tables.
1. Person_details --> This is created by entity class Persons.
2. Person_house --> This is created by entity class House.
3. Peron_Vehicle --> This is created by oneToMany Annotation in Person class which means 1 person can be many vehicles.
4. Person_vehicles --> This is created by entity class Vehicle.
5. Vehicles_person --> This is created by ManyToOne annotation in Vehicles class this means 1 Vehices own by many persons.



If you face while running the application then drop all the tables which is created by  previous application as same tables are used with different 
constraint so it may create the problem to srop and application may crash during startUp.

SELECT
  TABLE_NAME,
  COLUMN_NAME,
  CONSTRAINT_NAME,   -- <<-- the one you want! 
  REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME,
  REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME
FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE
WHERE
  REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME = 'person_details';
  
  This Query can be used to check which constraints are present.
