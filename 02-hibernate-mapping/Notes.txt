@OneToMany
	@JoinTable(name = "person_vehicle",
				joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="person_id"),

and there would ManyToOne mapping i.e. Many Vehicle will have one user.

@ManyToOne

@OneToOne
	@JoinColumns({
		@JoinColumn(name="Offer_id"),
		@JoinColumn(name="Price_plan")
	})
	private OfferDetails offerDetails;
